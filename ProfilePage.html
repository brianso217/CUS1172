    <h2> Programming Skills </h2>
      <p> My knowledge in programming is centered around Java, which I am proficient at (due to courses in St. John's). However,
          I am planning on learning Python and more languages relating to web development in the future, such as React, Angular,
          and Node.js. </p>

  <div id= "hobbies">
    <h2> General Interests </h2>
      <p> Before quarantine, I enjoyed going outside to play basketball, or exploring restaurants with my friends. Ever since
          quarantine began, I took up an interest in cooking. </p>

  <div id= "fav_site">
    <h2> Favorite Website </h2>
      <p> My favorite website to use is <a href= "https://www.youtube.com" target= "_blank"> Youtube.</a> This is due to the sheer amount of content
        available on the website that people can explore. Sometimes you go on there to listen to music and end up watching conspiracy theories that
        make absolutely no sense </p>
